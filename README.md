## Objective
The objective of this E-Academy platform is to offer an easy and intuitive system to bring together students and tutors for online tutoring services for any subject.

## Project Description
Creating an E-learning platform

## Features
E-Academy includes many features that make the booking and tutor allocation very simple to offer the best service with the least friction. Tutors can post their services and availabilities while students can browse the available time slots for any given course at any given time. Furthermore, E-Academy includes a feature that lets the tutor send feedback on each session to the parent if the student is a young child, or if the student is an adult the feedback for each session is sent directly to them to assess their progress. At the end of each week, a call is automatically scheduled at the end of the final session between the tutor and the parent/student and an in-depth assessment of the overall progress is given by the tutor to the client. In the case where a student is looking for a course at a time that is convenient for them, they can request a time slot and a tutor can reserve it at their convenience.

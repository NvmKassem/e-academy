# SOEN342 e-Academy Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to offer students hands-on experience in the domain of software engineering requirements elicitation, evaluatoin, and specification. By the end of the project, an interface for the platform will be created displaying all of the features included in the system.

## Project Description
The E-Academy platform offers an easy and intuitive system to bring together students and tutors for online tutoring services for any subject.

## Features

* Intuitive booking and tutor allocation
* Role-based account system
* Tutors can post their services and availabilities while students can browse the available time slots for any given course at any given time. 
* Tutors can send feedback on each session to the parent if the student is a young child, or if the student is an adult the feedback for each session is sent directly to them to assess their progress. 
* At the end of each week, a call is automatically scheduled at the end of the final session between the tutor and the parent/student and an in-depth assessment of the overall progress is given by the tutor to the client. 
* In the case where a student is looking for a course at a time that is convenient for them, they can request a time slot and a tutor can reserve it at their convenience.
